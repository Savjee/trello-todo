# Trello Todo

Simple node.js script that looks at all the Trello cards in my "Todo" list. If a card is almost due (in the next 7 days) it moves it to the "Soon" list.

More documentation coming soon...

Todo:
- [ ] Cleanup the Needle requests
- [ ] Convert into a Serverless project (for AWS Lambda)
- [ ] Add documentation (with examples & screenshot of Trello board)
- [ ] Move cards that are due today
